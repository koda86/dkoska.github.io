In terms of choosing appropriate statistics, there are some good reads about what not to do and how to implement methods for discrete data. See, e. g., the highly cited work by Bland and Altman (e.g the papers form 1986, or 2007), who introduced the so called Limits of Agreement (LoA) approach. There‚Äôs much less literature, however, on how to handle continuous differences between two measurement systems.\nOne interesting paper described a way to expand the LoA method to continuous data by using a functional approach (Roslien et al., 2012). The paper in a nutshell: Continuous data (aka curves) are approximated using functions to calculate a functional counterpart of the limits of agreement. The problem, however, is that the approach described in the paper is not entirely functional. Rather, the actual calculation of the Functional Limits of Agreement is carried out for each individual point of the previously determined functional curves (for details see the implementation in the utilized R package ‚Äòfda‚Äô by James Ramsay). Strictly speaking, this turns the whole idea of using functions on its head and results in functional LoA (or more generally: statistical bands) that a are likely too narrow (Koska et al., 2023). Applied to my original problem of describing continuous differences between measurement systems, this would mean that the random measurement error is likely underestimated.\nAnother paper that also describes a functional approach is the one by Lenhoff et al.¬†(1999). The paper is not per se about quantifying differences between measurement systems, but rather about the construction of statistical bands for (biomechanical) curve data. The actual hack in the paper is that the distribution of curves is estimated by bootstrapping the coefficients of these functions. This means that bands are no longer calculated pointwise, but the entire curve is included in the calculation. The method in Lenhoff et al., to the best of my knowledge, is based on the work of Olshen, Biden, Wyatt, and Sutherland from the 1980s (see, for example, Sutherland et al., 1988; Olshen et al., 1989).\n\nSutherland, D., Olshen, R., Biden, E., Wyatt, M., 1988.

Statist. 17 (4), http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/aos/1176347372.\n\nAs you can see, the method is not exactly new. I was all the more surprised that I wasn‚Äôt able to find a coded version of the algorithm online: So, I set about translating the formulas in the appendix of Lenhoff et al.¬†(1999) to R code - completely without Chat-GPT or CoPilot (crazy, I know). Extremely helpful at this point was the Matlab code that a former colleague at our institute, Doris Oriwol, kindly provided me with. This gave me the opportunity to cross-check my implementation. I probably would have made mistakes without her help, e.g.¬†with the adjustment of the width of the bootstrapped bands to the desired confidence level. Full credit to Doris!\nJust as a small interjection: I am very grateful for people who have the know-how and the time to review the code. The description in the Lenhoff paper is rather brief, and we were not always 100% sure whether we had correctly interpreted or implemented the description of the algorithm. Further opinions and possible corrections are very welcome anytime.\nIn the course of implementing the method, I also noticed something else: All examined bootstrap methods (including that of Roislien) have implemented a naive bootstrap, meaning they assume independence of the curves in the dataset. Accordingly, only one time series per subject was included in the bootstrap in these papers. From a methodological point of view, this is problematic since it ignores the intraindividual variance. In the context of investigating measurement errors, this means that the variance across repeated measurements within a person is not taken into account. This may further aggravate the problem of bands being too narrow.\nWe therefore extended the functional bootstrap bands to include a possibility to account for repeated measurements (i.e., dependent curves). This was realized through the two-stage bootstrap described in Davison and Hinkley (1997), in which subjects (including all of their curves) are sampled with replacement in the first stage, and one curve per subject is drawn without replacement in the second stage. In addition to the publication of the code, this implementation is, IMHO, the main contribution made by the FunBootBand method. Again, anyone who has comments, suggestions for improvement, or finds bugs, is welcome to get in touch. A systematic comparison of the method with the previously described methodological approaches (pointwise LoA, Functional LoA, Functional Bootstrapped bands) can be found in in Koska et al.¬†(2023).\nWhat follows are various versions of the functional bootstrap bands (ongoing development) in different programming languages. The R code has already been published as an R package. Future goals include making the code available in more programming languages and reducing the relatively high computation times (particularly due to bootstrapping). In R this may be done using RCpp, a C++ version. In Python, there is Cython, which should significantly reduce execution time. The goal is to make the method less accessible and thus further establish it. Of course, the method is not limited to the description of differences between measurement systems, but is useful wherever the variation of curve data needs to be analyzed statistically. This makes these functional bands a highly valuable tool.\n\n\nR version\nThe FunBootBand package contains a function to generate statistical (prediction or confidence) bands from curve data using a functional approach and bootstrapping.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe development version of FunBootBand can be installed from GitHub with:\ndevtools::install_github(‚Äúkoda86/FunBootBand‚Äù)\n\n\nPython version\nWork in progress, see here: [FunBoot]\n\n\nRCpp version\nOn my TODO list.\n\n\nEffort to compress (R code)\nWhile trying out different complexity measures, I stumbled upon the ‚Äòeffort to compress‚Äô (ETC) method introduced in (Nagaraj et al., 2013). ETC is a complexity measure for which code was originally presented as Matlab and Python Code. This repository contains an R implementation of the algorithm.\neffort2compress (GitHub)\nSee also the website of Nithin Nagaraj for the Matlab and Python versions: Website Nagaraj\nPython implementation: Github"
