Hey there! I'm currently working as a postdoc at Chemnitz University of Technology. My professional playground includes data analysis, research methods, and stats. Every now and then, I like to venture into the realm of machine learning and play with dynamic systems methods -- just to keep things interesting!

My PhD journey involved untangling the complexities of continuous biomechanical data, like how forces act or joints move.

I'm a big supporter of Free and Open Source Software -- it's the way to go!

You'll usually find me coding in R and Python, they're my trusty sidekicks.

Off the clock, I switch gears and jam on my bass. ðŸŽ¸
